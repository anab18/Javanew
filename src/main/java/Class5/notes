Logical operators:
    Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
    This is the third set of operators(Symbols) that we are
    discussing now. We have already discussed Arithmetic and
    relational operators. These are the symbols that we use for
    logical operators in java (||,&&,!).
Not(!):
    Not Operator is going to reverse the condition. if condition
    is true its gonna make it false and if condition is false
    its gonna make it true.
Why should we use NOT !:
