 Type casting is changing the datatype of data.
    data types from small to large.
    byte
    short
    int
    long
    float
    double.
    There are two types of type casting.
    Automatic/widening/implicit
        when we move from smaller boxes to large boxes it is
        called automatic/widening/implicit.
    Manual/Narrowing/explicit:
        When we move from a larger box to a smaller box.
Why we need type casting?
    1) Sometimes we might only be interested in whole numbers
    and want to ignore the decimal parts.
    2) When multiple developers work on the same project
    they might use different data types, and
    we might have to convert
    these before we merge their code.

     10>5  true
        5>7  false
        5<10 true
        12<10 false
        13==11 false
        15!=15 false
        10!=12 true
        1=>2 false or false -> false
        2=>2  true or false -> true
        10<=10 true or false -> true
        5<=8  true or false true
